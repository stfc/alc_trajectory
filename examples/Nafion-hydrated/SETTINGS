# This explanatory example defines the settings to analyse a NVE trajectory for a model of 
# "nano-confined water in Nafion". This is an example of a REACTIVE system, where bonds break and form, leading
# to the formation of new chemical species. The user can use a ASE to visualise the generated TRAJECTORY file. 
# Due to restrictions in the size of files to be stored in the repository, the trajectory is only 30 ps long,
# rather short for a rigorous analysis. For this reason, the present case shall be regarded as an example application
# For more details, the user is referred to the  use_code.md file of the root directory. Comments are preceded with 
# the symbol "#". The following blocks and directives do not have to comply with the order of appearance below. 
# They are just ordered this way only for explanatory purposes, and consistent with the use_code.md file.

##### The &search_chemistry block. This is needed if "change_chemistry" is set to "True" 
## This block must specify the criteria to analyse systems with changing chemical species. Activation of this block:
## 1) prints the file TRACK_CHEMISTRY with the xyz position of the chemical species along the trajectory
## 2) computes the residence times (RES_TIMES file) 
## 3) uses the information provided in the &lifetime block (and &data_analysis, see below) to compute the Transfer Correlation Function (TCP). In this case it will be the proton-TCF

## The directive "overlap_interval" is convenient to average quantities. 
## Computed averages will be printed to TCF_AVG, MSD_AVG and OCF_AVG files, as long as the blocks &lifetime, &msd and &ocf are defined (see below)

## IMPORTANT: by default, the computed OCF, TCF and MSD for all the multiple time intervals are not printed. In case the user still wants to print the results for all time intervals, the "print_all_intervals" directive

&end_lifetime

#### The &track_unchanged_chemistry block: allows tracking species that do not change their chemistry along the trajectory
## IMPORTANT: if for some unexpected reason the defined species to track change their chemistry, the analysis will be printed up to the frame when the species changed its chemistry
&track_unchanged_chemistry

&end_track_unchanged_chemistry 

#### The &coord_distrib block: computed the probability of finding a given species along the selected coordinate (x, y or z) for the trajectory
&coord_distrib

#### The &selected_nn_distances block: computes the probability density for the closest distance between the species defined, for the domain defined between lower_bound and upper_bound
&selected_nn_distances

&end_selected_nn_distances

#### The &orientational_chemistry block: computes the orientational correlation function associated with the changing chemical species.
&orientational_chemistry
  variable special_pair                       # defines the variable to define the orientation: the special pair in this case.  
&end_orientational_chemistry

#### The &region block: constrain the computation of MSD, OCF, CHEM_OCF, TCF, SPCF and RDF to a given region within the simulation cell.
## If this block is omitted, the whole simulation cell is considered.
## If one or two Delta directives are omitted, the whole spatial domain of the simulation cell along x, y or z is considered
## IMPORTANT: this block is convenient to systems with interfaces such as this example
## ALC_TRAJECTORY accepts multiple regions along x, y and z.
